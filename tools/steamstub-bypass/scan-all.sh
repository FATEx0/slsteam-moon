# scan-all.sh — proactive SteamStub bypass for every AddedApp.
#
# The runtime hook (feats/steamstub.cpp::onLaunchApp) processes a
# wrapped exe the first time the user clicks Play. That works, but:
#   - it adds a ~5-30 s delay on the very first launch of a fresh
#     install,
#   - it does nothing if Steam was started with an older SLSsteam.so
#     that lacked v3 support — the user may not realise a restart is
#     needed before clicking Play.
#
# This script does the same scan + unpack offline. Idempotent: an
# exe with an up-to-date `.steamless_done` marker is skipped, and an
# exe whose mtime is newer than the marker is reprocessed (handles
# Steam game updates that re-wrap the binary).
#
# Usage:
#   scan-all.sh                       # scan every AddedApp from
#                                     # ~/.config/SLSsteam/config.yaml
#   scan-all.sh <appid> [<appid> ...] # only the listed appids
#
# Exit code is 0 if every wrapped exe encountered was processed
# successfully (or already up to date). Non-zero if at least one
# helper invocation failed.

# test-launcher-basename.sh - the distro launcher must never be executed under
# a name it does not recognise.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# On Fedora/Nobara (and any distro shipping Valve's launcher directly)
# /usr/bin/steam is a symlink to /usr/lib/steam/bin_steam.sh, and that script
# derives its whole identity from its own argv[0]:
#
#     STEAMPACKAGE="${0##*/}"
#     if [ "$STEAMPACKAGE" = bin_steam.sh ]; then STEAMPACKAGE=steam; fi
#     case "$STEAMPACKAGE" in
#         steam) ... ;; steambeta) ... ;;
#         *) log "Unknown Steam package '$STEAMPACKAGE'"; exit 1 ;;
#     esac
#
# Our launcher shim captures the original as `<mirror>/steam.orig`. Executing
# that captured file under that name aborts the launch with
# "Unknown Steam package 'steam.orig'" BEFORE Steam opens its logger, so the
# user sees Steam simply not starting and no log is produced anywhere.
#
# Two independent layers are covered:
#   1. the generated shim must hand the wrapper (and its own fallback) a path
#      whose basename Valve's launcher accepts;
#   2. the wrapper must normalise ANY name-unsafe launcher it is told to run,
#      so a shim left behind by an older release cannot break the launch.
